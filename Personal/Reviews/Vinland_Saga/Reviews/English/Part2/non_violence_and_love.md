## The Collision of Ideas — Rethinking Non-Violence

The second season of the anime is, in my opinion, the most brilliant part of the entire work.

The author shows us a vision of how "zero violence" might be used to solve problems.

But we all know — in a world as complex as ours, can non-violence truly solve everything?

Because of this, I was deeply looking forward to how the author would lead us to reflect on this question in the subsequent manga arcs.

\
To be honest, I don't think the author gave a satisfying answer in the later storylines.

In some passages, it even felt overly idealistic, as though the complexity of the world was being ignored.

Even so, the questions the author raises are still well worth our deeper contemplation.

\
Can non-violence truly solve problems?

\
If we look at violence in a broad sense, then does verbal violence, institutional violence, or even more subtle forms of violence all fall under its umbrella?

If so, can non-violence truly be achieved? We might even ask: under such a broad definition, is violence always a bad thing?

\
Taking a step back, even if we look at violence in a narrow sense — limited to physical violence — does using self-defense to protect yourself from harm also count?

If it does, then Thorfinn has clearly violated his own beliefs multiple times.

\
From this perspective, I won't say that I agree with Thorfinn's absolutist non-violence.

When dealing with people who can be reasoned with through rational communication, non-violence is certainly viable. But when facing those who cannot be reached through reason, non-violence clearly has its limitations.

And if, in the course of adhering to non-violence, you end up allowing yourself or others to be harmed or killed — then what meaning does such non-violence even have?

## Love and Death

Speaking of death, the first season of the anime also posed another profound question: the relationship between love and death.

That perpetually drunk priest once had a deeply moving conversation with Canute, and this dialogue became a turning point in Canute's life [1].

The priest argued that death is the true expression of love. Only the dead harbor no hatred, commit no murder. Their bodies are offered freely to the earth, becoming nourishment for all living things — and that, he said, is true love.

What we commonly know as love — the love between family and friends — is, at best, merely a form of preferential treatment: an act of placing the value of certain individuals above others.

\
I agree with the priest's observation that what we commonly call love does indeed contain an element of preferential treatment.

But I would argue the opposite — that such preferential treatment may be precisely what constitutes the essence of love.

That is to say, love is an inherently exclusive emotion — an act of allocating limited resources to specific individuals.

\
Put another way, it is precisely because resources are limited and I choose to direct them toward certain people that my love for them is demonstrated.

Just as I treat my family better than I would treat a stranger on the street — it is because I love my family that I want to be kinder to them.

I believe that recognizing "objectively, all lives are equal; but subjectively, from each person's perspective, different lives hold different value" — that is the true nature of love.

\
However, for Canute, perhaps the point of this passage is not about the nature of love, but rather the question: "How should we redefine love in a world without faith?"

For the Vikings, love was something incomprehensible — a Christian incantation.

And the debates about "the nature of love" that I described above would likely be meaningless to them.

\
At this level, the essence of love depends not on reason, but on feeling.

Just as Canute held that snowball in his hand, feeling the sun, the breeze, seeing the trees, the mountains, the sky.

This world is so beautiful — and perhaps that thing which moves us to tears is what true love really is.

\
I would call such love a kind of faith.

And Canute, as he stated in his debate with Thorfinn [2], seeks to build a new faith for this world.

This new faith is meant to offer the bloodthirsty Vikings a place of redemption — somewhere their souls can find rest.

Much like Nietzsche's proclamation that "God is dead" — in a world without God, how should we save ourselves?

Nietzsche offered his answer, and Canute offers his own.

\
I believe this line of reflection, alongside "I have no enemies," represents the other most profound thematic idea in the entire work.

It is well worth savoring carefully.

## Conclusion

Looking at the work as a whole, as I mentioned before, this is a work with a brilliant story, incredibly three-dimensional character portrayals, and profoundly deep thematic ideas.

Although the later storylines in the manga give me the feeling of being raised to great heights only to be let down gently — posing questions of immense depth, yet ultimately providing only mediocre answers.

Moreover, the pacing feels somewhat drawn out and lacks tightness, which can leave the reader feeling fatigued.

But overall, this work still has an abundance of highlights that make it well worth experiencing. It is a rare gem in recent years.
